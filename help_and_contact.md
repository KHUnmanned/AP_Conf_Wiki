# Getting Help

If you have any questions or are unsure of anything please don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

## Before the Conference

In the lead up to the conference the best way to get in touch with us is by "at-ing" (_@Matt Kear_ or _@Peter Hall_) us on discord in either the [AP Conf 2025 Channel](https://discord.com/channels/674039678562861068/1326314979183562823), your private partner's channel or any of the developer channels.

## During the Conference

The staff at 3DXR, who are helping us to run the event, have kindly offered to act as single points of contact for any questions that you may have during the event. Just before the conference begins we will assign you with a point of contact and provide you with their contact details. Please reach out to them if you have any questions about the conference, the local area, or are stuck with travel arrangements and need some help.

You can also reach out to everyone on the [AP Conf 2025 Channel](https://discord.com/channels/674039678562861068/1326314979183562823) if you prefer. We will do our best to continuously monitor this channel during the event.
