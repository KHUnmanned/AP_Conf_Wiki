# Equipment Drop Off

If you need to drop off any equipment for demos at the conference venue, ideally we would prefer that you drop off the equipment at the venue in one of the days preceding the actual conference.

However, if you would prefer not to, or are unable, to do this then we will make space for you drive and park at the conference venue on the day that you are planning to do your demo(s).
