# Proposed Demos

Below is an active list that represents all of the demos that we currently know about. Please [Contact us](/help_and_contact) if you want to do a demo or want to update this information.

Where possible, we are trying to integrate the live demos such that they are inter-disbursed amongst the talks to break up the days. If you would specifically like your demo to follow your talk (or not follow your talk) please let us know to help us with scheduling.

::: warning Notice
To fit in with our schedule, all demos will be given up to a maximum of 15 min, time slot. Inclement weather may cause us to need to reshuffle the schedule. Please be prepared to be flexible on specific timings, on the day. If you genuinely believe you need more time for your demo, please [get in touch](/help_and_contact)

1. email info@3dxr.co.uk with "**ArduPilot Developer Conference 2025: Battery Loan**" in the title.

We will then see if we can find the same or an equivalent to offer you from our pool of batteries.
