## Operating Area

The map below outlines operating area for use during the conference. All items are clickable, providing pop-ups with more information. Red areas denote do-not-fly zones. Hazards and noise sensitive areas are also marked.

NOTAM H5655/25 will be in place 5th to 7th Sep only.

The most probable air risk will be from low-flying military aircraft (helicopters and fast jets). These aircraft do come below 120 m (400 ft) AGL so vigilance is necessary.
