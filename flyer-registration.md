# Flyer/Drone Registration

This page is intended to provide some helpful guidance for those that want to bring and/or fly an aircraft at the conference. Note that this is only applicable to airborne vehicles, it does not apply to rovers.

## Flyer ID

For anybody to be able to legally fly a >250g drone in the UK they must register for a **Flyer ID** with the UK CAA. This involves taking a short online knowledge test to demonstrate understanding of the local rules.

An overview of the rules can be found here: [The Drone and Model Aircraft Code](https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/drone-code)

The test can be found here: [Registering to use a drone or model aircraft](https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/individual/register-and-take-test-to-fly)

If you need any more information it is advisable to start [here](https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/individual)

We are hoping to create good opportunities for people to do some fun flying whilst at the conference. We will have a few small aircraft that we will be lending out to people that would like to do some fun-flying. We will also have some "Buddy-Box" transmitter setups available. Taking a leaf from the [guidance published by the British Model Flying Association (BMFA)](https://rcc.bmfa.club/caa-ids) there is **no need for a flyer ID for those that are on a buddy lead** or under very close supervision by an instructor.

## Operator ID

Typically in the UK, if you own and are responsible for a drone you must register for an operator ID. If you are brining a drone to operate at the conference, between 1st Sep to 8th Sep 2025, you can use KH Unmanned's Operator ID. To do this, you must:

- Read and agree to KH Unmanned's operating rules (provided to you at the event).
- Have a valid Flyer ID.
- Affix an operator ID sticker to your aircraft (provided to you at the event).

In addition, in using KH Unmanned's operator ID you will gain access to our 3rd-party public liability insurance, covering you for operations during the conference.

If however, you do not wish to use KH Unmanned's operator ID or you plan to use your drone in the UK outside of the dates/location specified above, then you will need to register for an operator ID. This can be done here: [Operator ID Registration](https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/individual/register-as-drone-operator) and currently costs Â£11.79.

::: tip Operator IDs for Sub 250 g
Operator IDs for sub 250 g aircraft are only required if a camera is fitted. See here: [Registration requirements](https://register-drones.caa.co.uk/registration-requirements-for-drones)
