# Travel Advice

This page offers advice about some of the options available for traveling to Richmond, North Yorkshire.

## Trains

Many will be flying into the UK via London Heathrow Airport (LHR).

One easy option to get to North Yorkshire is to take the train to Darlington (the nearest train station to Richmond).  You should expect that this journey will take you between 3h 45m to 4h to get from LHR to Darlington.  This route will take you:
- From LHR to London Paddington Train Station (don't forget to say hello to the Paddington Bear statue ðŸ˜Š).
- Cross London using the London Tube to London Kings Cross Station.
- A direct train from London Kings Cross to Darlington.

Once at the Darlington station you have two options:

1. Contact us (See [Help & Contact](./help_and_contact)) and we will collect you from Darlington Station.  Please give us some advanced notice so that we may arrange for one of our team to collect you.
2. If you prefer to make your own way there is a taxi rank at the train station.
