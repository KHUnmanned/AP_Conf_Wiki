# Bringing Family and Friends

We want the ArduPilot conference to be family friendly and we encourage you to bring them along. While the conference keeps everyone busy, Michelle Kear (Matt Kear's wife) and Libby Piper (Andy Piper's wife) will be running outings and social activities in the local area.

Some of the ideas for outings include:
- Get to know Richmond (including [Richmond Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/richmond-castle/) and [Easby Abbey](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/easby-abbey/)).
- Day trip to [York](https://visityork.org/) or [Durham](https://www.thisisdurham.com/) (Discover Northern English cities).
- The [Aukland Project](https://aucklandproject.org/) and [Barnard Castle](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/barnard-castle/)
- Plus many more ideas if these don't take your fancy.

Please be aware that many of the events will cost some amount of money. We have done our best to come up with a range of things to accommodate everyone's budget.  Michelle and Libby will let you know about expected costs ahead of each outing so that you can decide whether to come along.

If you want to know more, please provide contact details (email address) for the family & friends to Matt or Pete (See [Help & Contact](/help_and_contact)).  They will pass on the details so that Michelle and Libby can establish contact.

Even if you would prefer to do your own thing, but would like some advice.  We are more than happy to help. Please get in contact to say hello and ask any questions you may have.
