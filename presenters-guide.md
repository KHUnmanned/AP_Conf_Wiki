# Presenters Guide

The talks given by remote guests dialling into the event will be using the StreamYard video call platform. This records a high quality copy of the video call and uploads it immediately after the call, to help with any connection issues at the time.

## Preparation

In the weeks leading up to the event, if you are giving a talk remotely please take the opportunity to make sure you will have;

- A device with;
  - A compatible web browser (preferably up-to-date Chrome)
    - that is permitted to store data on-device, e.g. chrome://settings/content/siteData
    - that can use hardware acceleration if appropriate, e.g. chrome://settings/system
  - 5GB+ of free space
  - Camera
  - Microphone
  - Headphones/earphones
  - Mains power
- An internet connection that provides;
  - \>4Mbps upload internet connection (wired rather than WiFi if at all possible)
  - Unlimited upload (cellular providers may lock SIMs attempting to stream video)

You can check the internet connection and device you plan to use by following the links below from the device and connection that you plan to use;

- Platform host speed test [https://speed.cloudflare.com/](https://speed.cloudflare.com/)
- Platform sandbox Test Only \- [https://streamyard.com/qvn8u3i7s6](https://streamyard.com/qvn8u3i7s6) \- Test Only

## Technical FAQ

Below are some deep dives for each item of the checklist, in case you would like some extra guidance.

1. #### Power
   1. Make sure all devices are securely plugged in \- e.g. loose kettle leads can work their way out mid-stream\!

   2. Try to keep all trailing cables secured down and out the way, so you don’t run over it with your chair, or snag a cable with a gesture and pull over a mic stand.

   3. Even with everything being mains powered, using fully charged battery powered devices means you can continue even if there’s an issue with your mains.

2. #### Internet
   1. A wired ethernet connection direct to your router is the safest connection \- but the quality (ping, jitter and upload speed) of the connection to the building can vary with the time of day and day of the week.

   2. WiFi can work, but a weaker signal makes a worse connection, so may have issues from walls, people, etc coming between you and the wifi access point. Check it in exactly the same position and orientation as you will use on the day, and try to have an uninterrupted line of sight to the wireless access point.

   3. **Do not use 4G** _unless you’ve spoken to your provider specifically_ \- streaming over a hotspot can work for short calls, but your provider may lock the SIM card unless you have a contract for extended high speed upload.

For all internet connections, it is best to make sure that no other programs or devices will be using your internet connection whilst you’re streaming \- such as family members using a smart TV to watch netflix, or your work PC running a backup to a remote server.

For testing internet speed we recommend the below, as cloudflare partially hosts the platform;  
[https://speed.cloudflare.com](https://speed.cloudflare.com)

The important numbers are;

- Ping; Below 100ms, ideally below 50ms

- Jitter; Below 50ms, ideally below 30ms

- Download; At least 2Mbps, ideally above 4MBps

- Upload; At least 2Mbps, ideally above 8Mbps

3. #### Speakers
   1. Headsets are the simplest option unless you already have a good mic

   2. Headphones can be more comfortable for extended periods

   3. Earphones can work absolutely fine

   4. Wireless devices (e.g. bluetooth earbuds) have the risk of running out of battery or losing connection at the worst moment \- but may be a better mic than you have otherwise.

   5. Echo-cancelling setups can be okay, but if there’s significant background noise can have issues of noise-gating your speech.

Whichever you have available and use, it may be worth having another device to hand as a backup in case anything goes wrong. If you have multiple audio devices it can help to be familiar with their names so that you can select the correct ones from the lists. Let us know if you need help with any of this.

4. #### Mic
   1. Headsets are the simplest option unless you already have a good mic that you’re very comfortable using

   2. Lav/lapel mic’s can work very well as they naturally stay the same distance from your mouth, but can cause issues if you fidget or lift something up to camera

   3. Desk mic’s can have the best audio quality, but require attention to maintaining a consistent distance and orientation with your mouth \- and can pick up more noise from cable hum, desk shock, wind noise, plosives and sibilance.

   4. Wireless devices (e.g. bluetooth earbuds) have the risk of running out of battery or losing connection at the worst moment \- but can be a great option if you respect their range and battery life.

   5. Built-in laptop speakers and mics can be okay as a last resort, but the echo cancellation can have issues of noise gating your speech \- and having more than one on the same call can have unexpected problems.

As with the speakers, it’s advisable to have a backup, to have a bit of practice at switching devices, and to test the levels and position. It’s also important to have a quiet environment; close the door to pets, let anyone else in the vicinity know in advance, close the windows if there’s likely to be traffic noise, put your phone on vibrate \- BUT NOT ON A HARD SURFACE. Turn off TV’s, Hi-Fi’s,etc.

5. #### Camera
   1. External USB webcams work best
   2. Some of the cheapest action cameras (not GoPro’s) work well as webcams when plugged in via USB and put into PC Camera mode

   3. Smartphones can work well as external cameras \- [example](https://youtu.be/ebptyVvDtE8?t=571)

   4. Integrated webcams can do a good job if you light yourself well (light yourself, not your room\!)

With any of the above, the important thing is to have a roughly evenly lit environment, so that your face isn’t too much darker or too much brighter than the background \- without glare from direct lights. Ideally locating the camera close to where you’ll be looking, and at around the height of your eye-level. Cleaning the lens helps too\!

6. #### Call/Software
   1. We use a broadcast specific call system that uses your browser \- there’s no need to install or log in to any software

   2. Chrome or Firefox work best

   3. You will be asked to enter a display name, this will be publicly visible and will usually be how we address you when we’re live

7. #### Showtime
   1. Don’t Panic\! If you run into issues, stay calm, let us know and we’ll do what we can to help.

   2. Live Chat will only work if you are logged into YouTube

   3. Do not be tempted to open the stream link in another tab or on another device\!
