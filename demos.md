1. email info@3dxr.co.uk with "**ArduPilot Developer Conference 2025: Battery Loan**" in the title.
2. Ensure that you specify the battery make/model, dimensions, chemistry, capacity, and plug type that you normally use.

We will then see if we can find the same or an equivalent to offer you from our pool of batteries.
